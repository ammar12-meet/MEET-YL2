I like the idea for your app a lot, and it was a complicated idea, so I am glad that you were able to choose a small part of it that you were able to complete. It’s pretty cool that I can move the phone and get the small character to hit the dot (a mini version of temple run!). I’m glad you were able to figure out how to use sprites to make the pictures move. The interface was easy to figure out at the start of the app and it worked until I caught the ball. Then there was a problem with the app and it crashed, didn’t restart, and didn’t tell me what to do. For a perfect user experience, I would make sure something happened at the end of the app - a message for the user, restarting the targets, asking the user whether they want to continue or quit, or something like that. 

Great work on the app, and I hope you got something from it!
